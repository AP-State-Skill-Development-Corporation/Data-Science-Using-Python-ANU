**Sample input:**
 ```python
sentence = "Python Programming training on 05 dec 2020 to 26 dec 2020"
```

**Sample output:**
```python
Sum of numbers in a given string is 21
```
-----
2. Write a program to find factorial of given input number from the user?


- **Sample input1:**
```python
number = 5
```

**Sample output1:**
```python
Factorial of 5 is 120
```
- **Sample input2:**
```python
number = 4
```

**Sample output2:**

--------

10. Check the given number is Armstrong number or not
**Method 1:**
**Sample input:**
```python
Input: 153 or 1634
```
**Sample output:**
```python
Armstrong Number of 1634 is 1634
# Explanination: 1^3+5^3+3^3 = 153 or 1^4+6^4+3^4+4^4 = 1634
```
**Method 2**
